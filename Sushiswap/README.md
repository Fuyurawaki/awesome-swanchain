## SushiSwap

SushiSwap was launched in September 2020 by two anonymous developers called Chef Nomi and 0xMaki. It is one of the most popular Decentralized Applications (DApp) on the Ethereum blockchain. SushiSwap adopts the automated market-making (AMM) model for its decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. Simply put, there is no order book on SushiSwap. Instead, the buying and selling of crypto are facilitated by smart contracts and the price is determined by an algorithm.
